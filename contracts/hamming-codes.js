    HammingCodes: Encoded Binary to Integer
    
    You are given the following encoded binary string:
    '0010000000110010000011100101111001100111011110011111001001011110'

    Treat it as an extended Hamming code with 1 'possible' error at a random index.
    Find the 'possible' wrong bit, fix it and extract the decimal value, which is hidden inside the string.

    Note: The length of the binary string is dynamic, but its encoding/decoding follows Hamming's 'rule'
    Note 2: Index 0 is an 'overall' parity bit. Watch the Hamming code video from 3Blue1Brown for more information
    Note 3: There's a ~55% chance for an altered Bit. So... MAYBE there is an altered Bit ðŸ˜‰
    Note: The endianness of the encoded decimal value is reversed in relation to the endianness of the Hamming code. Where the Hamming code is expressed as little-endian (LSB at index 0), the decimal value encoded in it is expressed as big-endian (MSB at index 0).
    Extra note for automation: return the decimal value as a string
